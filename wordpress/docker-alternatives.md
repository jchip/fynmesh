```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/local/var/www/wordpress;
    index index.php index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

### Setup WordPress:
```bash
# Create directory
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/www/wordpress
cd /usr/local/var/www/wordpress

# Download WordPress
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz --strip-components=1
rm latest.tar.gz

# Set permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /usr/local/var/www/wordpress
