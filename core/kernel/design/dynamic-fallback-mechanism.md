# Dynamic FynApp Fallback Mechanism

## Problem Statement

Current dependency resolution requires perfect upfront knowledge of all FynApp dependencies, which creates brittleness:
- Build-time dependency analysis may miss dynamic scenarios
- Runtime failures when expected FynApps aren't loaded
- Complex dependency graphs that are hard to manage
- Poor developer experience when dependencies change

## Solution Approach

Implement a **reactive fallback mechanism** that handles missing FynApps on-demand during import attempts. Instead of failing immediately, the system:

1. **Detects missing remote containers** during dynamic import attempts
2. **Automatically discovers and loads** the required FynApp
3. **Suspends the import** until the FynApp is available
4. **Resumes the import** transparently once loaded
5. **Provides graceful degradation** if loading fails

## Key Principles

- **Zero Code Changes**: FynApps continue using standard `import()` syntax
- **Transparent Operation**: Fallback mechanism is invisible to applications
- **Federation-js Only**: Implementation contained entirely within federation-js
- **Resilient by Default**: System handles missing dependencies gracefully

## Solution Components

### 1. Import Interception
Federation-js intercepts dynamic imports at the Module Federation container level. When a FynApp attempts to import from another FynApp, the system checks if the target remote container is loaded before proceeding.

### 2. Missing Remote Detection
The system maintains state about loaded remote containers and can detect when an import targets a container that isn't available. This includes version compatibility checking when version requirements are specified.

### 3. Automatic Remote Loading
When a missing remote is detected, the system automatically:
- Discovers the remote container URL using multiple strategies
- Loads the remote container script
- Initializes the container with proper share scope
- Registers the container for future use

### 4. Import Suspension and Resumption
While the remote container is being loaded, the original import is suspended. Once the container is available, the import resumes transparently. Multiple imports to the same missing remote are batched together.

### 5. Discovery Strategies
Multiple strategies for finding remote containers:
- **Registry Lookup**: Check internal remote registries
- **Convention-based URLs**: Try standard URL patterns like `/fynapps/{name}/fynapp-entry.js`
- **Global Registry**: Use shared federation registries if available
- **Environment Configuration**: Check environment variables for base URLs

### 6. Graceful Degradation
Configurable fallback strategies when remote loading fails:
- **Throw**: Fail with descriptive error (default)
- **Mock**: Return mock module that logs warnings
- **Skip**: Return null and continue execution

## Implementation Scope

This mechanism is implemented entirely within **federation-js** and requires **zero changes** to:
- FynApp code - continues using standard `import()` syntax
- Kernel code - no modifications needed
- Build tools - existing rollup configuration works unchanged
- Any other FynMesh components

## User Experience

From a FynApp developer perspective, nothing changes:

```javascript
// FynApp code remains exactly the same
const components = await import('fynapp-x1/main', {
  with: { type: "mf-expose", requireVersion: "^2.0.0" }
});

// The fallback mechanism works transparently:
// 1. If fynapp-x1 is loaded → import succeeds immediately
// 2. If fynapp-x1 is missing → system loads it automatically, then import succeeds
// 3. If fynapp-x1 can't be found → configurable fallback behavior
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilient Loading**: No need for perfect dependency resolution upfront
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Can handle FynApps not known at build time
3. **Lazy Loading**: Only loads FynApps when actually needed
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Configurable fallback strategies
5. **Better UX**: Suspends imports instead of failing immediately
6. **Simpler Development**: Developers don't need to manage complex dependency graphs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Interception
- Implement import interception
- Basic missing FynApp detection
- Simple URL discovery strategies

### Phase 2: Advanced Loading
- On-demand FynApp loading
- Import suspension/resumption
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 3: Discovery Enhancement
- Multiple discovery strategies
- Registry integration
- Version compatibility checking

### Phase 4: Production Features
- Caching and optimization
- Monitoring and observability
- Advanced fallback strategies

This approach provides a much more flexible and resilient foundation for federated applications while maintaining simplicity for developers.
